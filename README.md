# miner-monitor

I've attached a smart relay to a mining rig that mines in a hiveon pool.
Sometimes the rig gets disconnected from the pool, resulting in profit loss.

I've decided to create a simple script to check if the miner is connected to the pool every X minutes, and reboot the rig using the relay if the rig is offline.

Simple tool for personal use, might improve on it if I have some spare time.
